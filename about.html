    <h1>Instructor: James Munroe</h1>

    <p>I work in the Department of Physics and Physical
    Oceangraphy.  My physical oceanography research includes 
    numerical models, lab experiments, and field observation.  This diverse 
    approach requires a wide array of computational
    tools and techniques.</p>
