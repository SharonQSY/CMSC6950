## Welcome to CMSC6950

Welcome to the website for CMSC6950.  Please contact [Dr. James Munroe](mailto:jmunroe@mun.ca) if you have any questions about the course.

The first lecture will be May 2, 9-12, in C-2039.  

On Thursday, April 21, 2016 I was alerted that some students haven't been able to register because the class is at capacity due to how the course has been set up with the Registrar's Office.  I've increased the max enrolment to allow more students to take this course. Please let me know if there are any additional issues.
