## Welcome to CMSC6950

Welcome to the website for CMSC6950.  Please contact Dr. James Munroe if you have any questions about the course.

The first lecture will be May 2, 9-12, in C-2039.  

On Thursday, April 21, 2016 I was alerted that some students haven't been able to register because the class is at capacity due to how the course has been set up with the Registrar's Office.  I am looking into increasing this capacity limit -- at this time, my understanding is there should be plenty of space for additional students to register.  Thanks for your patience.
